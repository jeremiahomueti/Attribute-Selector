The Attribute Selector

Explanation: Some stuff or element, such as an input, can
contain varying nature of inputs. Such as texts, numbers, 
passwords, etc.

So, say there is a sign up or login page, contianing two inputs:
username [        ]
password [        ]


The username input is a 'text' type; whereas, the password input 
is a 'password' type - which will display the inputted passwords
in dotted masks [*******]


So, to modify the username text color, and make it blue, for instance...

We do the following:

input[type="text"] {
    color: blue;
}

This makes all password username inputs have a text color of
blue.


*************************************************************

Even a class is an attribute. So we can say, any section,
where class is equal to "post" should have a background color of
grey.

section[class="post"] {
    background-color: grey;
}


That's just for showing that it is possible to select classes
using that approach, but it may be better to just type the class 
directly, i.e.

.post {
    background-color: grey;
}

...in this context, that is, in the use case of classes.

We can also do:

section.post {
    background-color: grey;
}
